xle = 0.0       
yle = 0.0       
xte = 1.0       
yte = 0.0       
                
rle: Leading edge radius
                                
x_pre: x-location of minimum point on the lower (pressure) surface
y_pre: y-location of minimum point on the lower (pressure) surface
d2ydx2_pre: 2nd derivative at the location of the minimum point on the lower (pressure) surface
th_pre: Trailing edge angle between the lower (pressure) surface and the horizontal axis
                                                
x_suc: x-location of maximum [Y] point on the upper (suction) surface
